# Numerically Solutions to the Schrödinger equation
This is a set of python code which can be used to solve the schrodinger equation in one dimension numerically.
The code uses Numerov's integration, and currently only works for one dimensional systems.
But the code idea can be expanded to higher dimesnions.
Here the code is used to solve the eigen states of a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
